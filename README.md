# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations for various data structures and algorithms in C++ as part of a university assignment.

## Contents

The repository contains the following data structures and algorithms:

### Linked List
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

### Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

### Memory Manager
- Custom memory manager for efficient memory allocation

### Hash Table
- Hash table with chaining for collision resolution

### AVL Tree
- Self-balancing binary search tree

### Cache
- Implements a least recently used (LRU)

## Documentation

Each folder contains a README.md file that provides:

- Description of the data structure/algorithm
- Overview of implementation files
- Instructions for building and testing
- Guidance on usage
- Analysis of time and space complexity

## Testing

Unit testing for implementations are done using the [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) framework. The tests aim to cover common use cases and corner cases.

CMake is used as the build system. Instructions for compiling and running tests are in the README.md of each module.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues and pull requests to improve documentation and testing coverage.
